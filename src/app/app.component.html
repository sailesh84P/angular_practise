<details>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type specimen book.</details>

<!-- Second Brief -->
<details>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</details>

<!-- Third Brief -->
<details>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
    at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters</details>

<!-- Fourth Brief -->
<details>as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
    uncover many web sites still in their infancy. </details>

<!-- Fifth Brief -->
<details>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
    going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. </details>

<!-- Sixth Brief -->
<details>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
    some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</details>
